This is the wiki page for Data-Wiki, a Drupal-based product that allows crowd-sourced collaborative editing of community data.

The main instance of Data-Wiki is currently a product called "CityGroups" (http://citygroups.org)
This will be the main instance of the product for the time being.

CityGroups is in active development as part of Code for America (Summer 2011.)

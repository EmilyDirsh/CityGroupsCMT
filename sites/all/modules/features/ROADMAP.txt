Refactoring the features to make them more intuitively named & less buggy.

This requires moving all the old features into the new feature structure (mostly by hand.)

* New naming structure for the features. (done)
* Set up all the features containers. (done)
* Set up major dependency structure in relation to install profile. (done)

-- Profile installs the theme & as *few* settings as possible.

-- Installs datawiki_install which has the main Drupal features.
---- datawiki_install loads up special views & settings for all Datawikis.
---- Dev version installs datawiki developers.
-- Since we are starting with a CityGroups install profile (a flavor of a DataWiki), 
   that installs the theme, and also triggers the loading of features special for CityGroups.
-- The CityGroups installer loads up the citygroups_install feature.
---- CityGroups install loads the community group install feature, and special views and other tools for City Groups.

The install features load up settings, views, content types, feeds.

The goal, later on, is to have it be possible to have other install profiles, 
but especially to add other content types as necessary while keeping largely similar interactions.
